    1. Job Title and Description: Look for terms related to software engineering such as "Software Engineer," "Developer," "Programmer," or similar titles. Read the description to ensure it aligns with typical software engineering duties.

    2. Application Form: Check for fields where applicants can enter their personal information, such as name, email, phone number, resume/CV, and cover letter. These fields must be present on the web page. 

    3. Submission Mechanism: Identify if there is a visible button or link that allows users to submit their application, often labeled as "Apply," "Submit," or similar.
