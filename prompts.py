You will be given a list called HTML_INPUT_ELEMENTS. Each input element in HTML_INPUT_ELEMENTS is an HTML input element that is searchable on a company's career website.   
You should pick one input element that is prompting the user to search for specific job openings in the company. The input element you pick should be
the most relevant for searching for software engineer job openings on a company's career website. This selected input element allows the user to directly enter the job role or title they are searching for, which is a common and effective way to find specific job listings on a company's career site.

Pick an input element from HTML_INPUT_ELEMENTS. Remember, YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD ONLY BE THE INPUT ELEMENT and NOTHING ELSE.
